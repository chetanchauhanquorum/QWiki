00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.075
Everyone today I'll be demoing this bug
in the rate seasonal profile maintenance

1e405ea5-9e13-4648-a18e-59e36c9b0fde-1
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:16.070
screen where if the user tries to access
this functionality of import from Excel

1e405ea5-9e13-4648-a18e-59e36c9b0fde-2
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.942
and if you try to save this data,
then these validation errors were

1e405ea5-9e13-4648-a18e-59e36c9b0fde-3
00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:22.719
occurred.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.354
And also if you access this bulk edit
view functionality here also you can see

3aa60da3-6748-4018-a0e3-c1f6d9647e1f-1
00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:35.280
that there's one additional slash that is
being added.

a97ba940-ae2a-4018-b2b7-b74c10c015f4-0
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.918
So basically the issue was that the
format change logic in the import in the

a97ba940-ae2a-4018-b2b7-b74c10c015f4-1
00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:52.311
Excel import function was missing due to
which when when the system was passing

a97ba940-ae2a-4018-b2b7-b74c10c015f4-2
00:00:52.311 --> 00:01:00.600
the data from the Excel it was getting
passed as it is like for example 01/01.

cc495011-b820-4e82-ab4e-e81f590f744d-0
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.340
Then the function was passing the data as
it is 01/01 and as a result and as a

cc495011-b820-4e82-ab4e-e81f590f744d-1
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.080
result you can see the additional slash
here as well as the validation errors.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.200
So after after making the fix you can see
that.

fc4febbf-5595-4e35-98c4-6153fb5faa98-0
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.870
You can see here in the bulk attitude
that the additional slash which was

fc4febbf-5595-4e35-98c4-6153fb5faa98-1
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.564
visible here is now gone and if you try
to save the data,

fc4febbf-5595-4e35-98c4-6153fb5faa98-2
00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:45.560
the data is being saved successfully.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.176
So basically the this issue,
we face this issue because of the

a074e74b-10c1-47f6-9f07-6e5eecb66c4a-1
00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:59.724
previous bug which was related to Excel
export and bulk edit functionalities

a074e74b-10c1-47f6-9f07-6e5eecb66c4a-2
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:07.469
where the user was seeing a incorrect
format in the Excel such As for example,

a074e74b-10c1-47f6-9f07-6e5eecb66c4a-3
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.920
01, 01 without the slash.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.348
So at that time they fixed this issue by
adding this slash and in both the bulk

4ca099f2-d5fe-4767-94c5-a202a4c10474-1
00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:21.280
edit and and Excel import and Excel
export.

d8ff5f39-d8c6-4a53-a5ae-ddc0bcccff4c-0
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.049
So but they didn't add the reverse format
change in the Excel import due to which

d8ff5f39-d8c6-4a53-a5ae-ddc0bcccff4c-1
00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.720
we face this issue.
