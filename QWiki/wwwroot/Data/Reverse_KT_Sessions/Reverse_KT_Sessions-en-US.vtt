00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:06.257
Capricorn it is.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/14-0
00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:08.897
The Capricorn is not yet completed.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/18-0
00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:12.747
So it was inventory, so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/60-0

inventory.
So for customer account maintenance,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/60-2

Then.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/70-0
00:00:34.247 --> 00:00:35.767
The header remains the same.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/74-0
00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:36.007
The TSP.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/75-0
00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.327
This is auto generated.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/92-0
00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:43.407
We define the beginning of the accounting
method and of the accounting month.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/100-0

We create.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/101-0
00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:49.527
The detail for the contact like for the
customer account.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/104-0
00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:51.447
Which contract?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/107-0
00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:53.647
In which the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/112-0
00:00:55.527 --> 00:00:56.887
Inventory pick.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/129-0
00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:02.897
Whatever the activity is present for that
contract for that customer,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/129-1
00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:04.467
according to that contract.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/134-0
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:08.187
So if other than this primary contract,
some of the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/145-0
00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.287
Another secondary contracts are there
which we can add in this contract.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/178-0
00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:21.529
Is that contact order that's come
automatically when we select the primary

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/178-1
00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:27.855
contact contact, then the balance field.
So balance field here it shows the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/178-2
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.687
monthly monthly basis.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/208-0
00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:35.993
The received and the delivery field and
in activity it shows on the date wise

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/208-1
00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:41.369
like for each date which activity has
happened like how much gas has been

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/208-2
00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.967
delivered or received.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/221-0
00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:48.357
And I didn't understand the authorization
to post imbalance.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/227-0
00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:52.877
Like,
where do we use this like you fixed that?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/230-0
00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:56.617
Is that good?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/250-0
00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:07.588
Customer account summary was used to view
the overall for that customer for the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/250-1
00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:09.047
business party.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/271-0
00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:14.261
Like what are the sort of contents are
there so on monthly basis for a single

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/271-1
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:18.607
business subscription,
we can view all year and a single screen.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/282-0
00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:22.407
So customer account somebody was there.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/285-0
00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.037
Go to authorize.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/291-0
00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:32.297
You know, this is to specify that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/299-0
00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:36.487
From which date the authorization will be
effective?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/301-0
00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:38.207
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/305-0
00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:41.867
Mr. Chinto junior would be.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/310-0
00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.327
So it should be like.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/317-0
00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:54.527
A contract to to effective date of.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/321-0
00:02:56.407 --> 00:02:57.927
Service relation I think.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/362-0
00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:01.460
<v Pooja Joshi>Yes,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/362-1

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/362-2

<v Pooja Joshi>While running the batch process,
you can see that authorization batch</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/362-3

<v Pooja Joshi>process are also executed.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/363-0

Back.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/376-0
00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:22.495
<v Pooja Joshi>Uh, Vaishnavi, if you are talking,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/374-0

Yep.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/379-0
00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:26.697
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/402-0
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.140
<v Pooja Joshi>Yeah, go ahead. So just that's it.
If we if we create a contract now,</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/402-1
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.494
<v Pooja Joshi>so it it will be automatically tied up to
the authorization to post imbalance</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/402-2
00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:38.975
<v Pooja Joshi>screen.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/403-0
00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:40.597
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/408-0
00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:48.647
ESPN entry.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/416-0
00:03:54.707 --> 00:03:56.667
You were talking about customer account.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/420-0
00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:58.867
Yeah, customer account summary was.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/433-0
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:04.058
Based on the BA,
the whole monthly basis separately would

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/433-1
00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.027
be given as single screen.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/435-0
00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:09.597
Yes.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/438-0
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:14.357
Mr.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/447-0
00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:17.127
Storage account activity.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/449-0
00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:20.847
So here like this 3 slide.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/462-0
00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:24.087
I will tell you what I understand.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/469-0
00:04:24.087 --> 00:04:26.407
I'm not sure that that is correct or not.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/496-0
00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:33.880
So here it mentioned like the storage
injection transfer to A to the 864

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/496-1
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.583
location.
So the storage allocation remains the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/496-2
00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:39.367
same so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/506-0
00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:44.767
Because of the like,
this would be the loss right for 100 so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/522-0
00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:50.577
Because the delivery is gross,
so that hundred would not be reflected

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/522-1
00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:50.807
yet.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/524-0
00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:52.247
So the balance shown is 0.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/528-0
00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:54.657
So which is not correct.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/543-0
00:04:56.207 --> 00:05:01.367
So now they've done this key for that 8X
reward, it is not allocated.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/545-0
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:03.367
Allocated.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/558-0
00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:07.727
So now the balance is of 1900.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/574-0
00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:13.340
So now the storage part gives the
nomination to 861,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/574-1
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.127
but it does not deliver that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/582-0
00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:17.807
So here it is plus 1900.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/592-0
00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:20.896
So like,
is this a way of dealing with the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/592-1
00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:22.807
location which are not allocated?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/595-0
00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:26.337
Pizza storage.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/603-0
00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:30.317
Yeah, because of the normal normal, yes.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/626-0
00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:32.847
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/627-0
00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:37.786
Makeup and payback is like if they've
taken more than the receipt,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/627-1
00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:40.807
then they're to give back to the pipeline.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/642-0
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:46.155
Payback is, if they're not taken,
then what they're received so they can

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/642-1
00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:48.207
take more from the pipeline.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/644-0
00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:49.167
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/680-0
00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:57.525
This is makeup and payback and one thing
they mentioned here is why they don't

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/680-1
00:05:57.525 --> 00:06:03.406
prefer cache in cash out is if the
imbalance is above like 5% or 10%,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/680-2
00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:05.087
it's generally cost.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/685-0
00:06:06.127 --> 00:06:07.647
Loss to the party.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/701-0
00:06:07.877 --> 00:06:13.717
So they try to balance their emerald
using the field read only instead of CSU.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/720-0
00:06:15.857 --> 00:06:22.164
So here is the ibws is the website I
guess on which all the inventory are

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/720-1
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:23.017
available.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/731-0
00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:28.417
So they look for the party which where
they can settle down their trades.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/737-0
00:06:30.217 --> 00:06:32.217
Have you discovered I could have used it?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/739-0
00:06:33.287 --> 00:06:33.887
I don't know.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/744-0
00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:43.357
Imbalanced trading.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/750-0
00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:47.667
So it is present in the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/753-0
00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:50.327

In this add just one note like.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/804-0
00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:18.497
What I've seen in the was like the person
who is filling this form will fill the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/804-1
00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:23.167

Accordingly,
he will fill information and he will.

00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:28.367
He will just put the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/825-0
00:07:29.327 --> 00:07:31.047
Confirming Trader name on that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/835-0
00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:35.645
Just the starting date.
The contact details is filled by the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/835-1
00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:36.927
confirming party.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/851-0
00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:43.997
But how do they communicate like I'm
feeling on like I'm feeling for your?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/859-0
00:07:45.447 --> 00:07:48.367
That business third party and how do they
get?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/876-0
00:07:50.447 --> 00:07:54.814
So I'm not sure,
but when you fill this imbalanced trading

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/876-1
00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:56.887
form, it's impending status.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/884-0
00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:01.367
Then you have to confirm it.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/891-0
00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:03.727
So there is a process again for
confirmation.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/894-0
00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:06.827
Not for.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/900-0
00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:09.487
Not a batch process.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/921-0
00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:19.426
Like my question is like if you look on
the website that he could deal with that

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/901-0
00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:12.737
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/921-1
00:08:19.426 --> 00:08:22.367
party like there's invalid there.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/932-0
00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:29.327
So if it says detail but any so he would
get notified on what like?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/944-0
00:08:30.247 --> 00:08:34.607
There is a party where applied for a
trade with you for this imbalance.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/967-0
00:08:35.637 --> 00:08:39.530
Or like how do they 2 two parties
communicate that they're feeling this?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/967-1
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.397
They feel this one together, right?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/970-0
00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:43.757
So how do they communicate like?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/972-0
00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:50.297

OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/983-0
00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:53.277
I'm not sure but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/984-0
00:08:53.277 --> 00:08:55.637

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/992-0
00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:05.797
We can cause this to come here.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/996-0
00:09:08.007 --> 00:09:09.087
Thank you, Lord.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1011-0

00:09:26.727 --> 00:09:30.367
The paper details and then the contract
is there,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1043-1
00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:36.047
and then similarly for the confirmed
party. And then we can submit this form.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1051-0

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1052-0
00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:42.637
4.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1057-0
00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:45.837
You have to confirm it.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1068-0

confirmed it comes back to us.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1095-0
00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:03.074
I'm here to try this imbalance and
billing process.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1095-1
00:10:03.074 --> 00:10:06.722
I'm currently going through that for
capacity,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1095-2
00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:10.837
capacity release and after that I will
try for this.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1120-0
00:10:11.575 --> 00:10:14.620

<v Pooja Joshi>So I'll search and will share with you so
that we'll give the better understanding</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1120-2

<v Pooja Joshi>for this one.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1122-0
00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:22.367
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1123-0
00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:23.615
<v Pooja Joshi>Yeah.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1126-0
00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:28.377
I guess the system.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1139-0
00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:36.237
Balance validation.
Some nomination or notifications.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1147-0
00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:39.557
OK,
so the 10 coming back and get notified.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1150-0
00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:41.157
Yeah, I think so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1169-0
00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:47.117
I'm not sure but last time I worked in
the I thought so it can.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1170-0
00:10:47.637 --> 00:10:51.357
Be like I also thought that they might
get notified for.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1189-0
00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:59.148
The confirming parties gets notified when
an imbalance in pending state is get

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1173-0
00:10:52.047 --> 00:10:52.207
That.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1189-1
00:10:59.148 --> 00:10:59.817
added.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1188-0
00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:00.677
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1197-0
00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:03.217
Yeah, they get a notification for that,
but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1213-0
00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:08.999
Before filling their form,
they would have other communication like

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1213-1
00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.997
they don't go and fill out for the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1231-0
00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:16.490
They might have validations for
verification like they're using the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1231-1
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.377
correct data and then get more than maybe.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1241-0
00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:24.877
No, like they could be more parties there,
no.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1260-0
00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:30.290
So if a person is filling this form for
one confirming party,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1260-1
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.277
so how do they do like personally they
would.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1281-0
00:11:34.997 --> 00:11:38.946
Communicate and then they would fill out
the formal or fill filling out the form

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1281-1
00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:40.117
for more than one party.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1289-0
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:46.117
And if someone gets someone accepts it,
then that's what. Confirm it like that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1296-0
00:11:48.547 --> 00:11:50.827
It's only 25.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1295-0
00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:50.347

Yeah, but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1319-0
00:11:54.087 --> 00:11:59.705
Maybe, maybe shrug and say, oh,
it's like Abhishek is in office today.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1331-0
00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:58.607
Maybe.
Maybe she'll have taken all this else.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1319-1
00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:01.367
You can reach out to.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1341-0
00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:00.347
In office.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1340-0
00:12:00.757 --> 00:12:02.317
Yes, that's it.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1342-0
00:12:02.387 --> 00:12:02.467

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1353-0
00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:12.887
So storage transfer maintenance from it
will also same thing.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1372-0
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:20.724
Like the other party,
details are filled here and the storage.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1372-1
00:12:20.724 --> 00:12:23.867
The transfer quantities decide and.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1378-0
00:12:26.107 --> 00:12:28.427
The that ship is like.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1398-0
00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:34.642
Storage between those parties,
so the storage get transferred to the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1398-1
00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.267
another party confirming party.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1405-0
00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:48.057

That's OK, great.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1413-0
00:12:54.987 --> 00:12:56.107
It is not that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1427-0
00:12:56.147 --> 00:13:01.187
I guess this is in the cloud sync,
so there is also one more field.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1430-0
00:13:01.187 --> 00:13:03.307
So whatever the form we have submitted
here.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1447-0
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:11.467
In like in a single screen we can see
multiple form for this storage and.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1464-0
00:13:05.457 --> 00:13:11.270
Like in a signal screen,
we can see multiple form for this storage

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1464-1
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.617
and.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1479-0
00:13:28.587 --> 00:13:33.667
Doing this summary field for more than
one month and we've seen in the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1489-0
00:13:46.737 --> 00:13:50.257
This was I understood from this was that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1500-0
00:13:51.907 --> 00:13:54.147
It was used to transfer the imbalance.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1518-0
00:13:54.147 --> 00:14:01.259
Maybe I have to take a make a take
deliveries of 2000 so I can transfer that

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1518-1
00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:04.307
to another party using inventory.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1520-0
00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:05.977
Stupid.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1524-0
00:14:06.427 --> 00:14:07.627
Inventory.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1526-0
00:14:09.227 --> 00:14:09.347
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1539-0
00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:30.977
We are like the accounting Monday it is
mentioned and.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1552-0
00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:37.227
Both the parties name is their services
there so that contacts for this.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1573-0
00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:45.009
This party gets transferred to the other
parties contact and the quantity and the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1573-1
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.107
adjustment is we can change.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1583-0
00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:49.307
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1584-0
00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:52.387
This is why we are inventory adjustment.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1604-0
00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:58.893
So if you transfer from one contact to
another contact,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1604-1
00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:03.737
you will see here the positive and you
will be there but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1623-0
00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:10.587
Your value is cut down from this location
and it is given to one of them.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1646-0
00:15:11.147 --> 00:15:15.867
So for this location you will see a
negative value in brackets.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1637-0
00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:16.357
OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1647-0
00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:20.187
For that same record,
whenever you see a value.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1654-0
00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:22.767
Directions to sandy, Ontario.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1663-0
00:15:20.947 --> 00:15:24.694
In quantity in bracket,
it is a -1 means it is given to someone

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1663-1
00:15:24.694 --> 00:15:24.987
else.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1673-0
00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:32.467
And this also reflects in the inverse,
so for the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1685-0
00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:38.677
Even this data is reflected in
authorization to post imbalance screen.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1688-0
00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:41.367
Yeah.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1697-0
00:15:44.587 --> 00:15:45.387
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1711-0
00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:52.384
<v Pooja Joshi>So I'm sharing one of the test case which
is related to the inventory.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1711-1
00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:56.455
<v Pooja Joshi>So we'll go through it once you are done.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1713-0
00:16:00.535 --> 00:16:00.815
<v Pooja Joshi>OK.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1721-0
00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:08.335
<v Pooja Joshi>Your voice is getting back.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1755-0
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:14.964
Yeah, I was not reading it.
So for the this is the timeline sheet.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1755-1
00:16:14.964 --> 00:16:21.119
So for the previous production month in
the next like in the production month

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1755-2
00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:24.197
after the the accounting will be there.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1786-0
00:16:25.387 --> 00:16:30.007
Then that accounting month,
there is a 5 days work days window to

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1786-1
00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:35.607
train for the imbalances and that could
be reflected in that particular month's

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1786-2
00:16:35.607 --> 00:16:38.827
balance and also so the invoice created
that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1806-0
00:16:39.607 --> 00:16:44.301
To otherwise,
if these are not done in that period,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1806-1
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:49.447
then it would run the CXO processes for
that imbalances.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1818-0
00:16:50.347 --> 00:16:53.467
Another is PPA like PPA CS0.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1830-0
00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:57.252
So for that,
we wait for two months like it said

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1830-1
00:16:57.252 --> 00:16:58.427
two-month period.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1842-0
00:16:58.507 --> 00:17:04.133
So after the production month,
the next month and another next month for

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1842-1
00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:04.827
that, so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1860-0
00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:10.707
That another one they give the priority
imbalance rating window for that.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1878-0
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:17.140
And if they didn't settle it there,
then they get the cache and cache

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1878-1
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.467
activated here.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1900-0
00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:25.126
Otherwise,
we there is one more process of monthly

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1900-1
00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:28.544
inventory.
So we can increase that invariance window

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1900-2
00:17:28.544 --> 00:17:30.157
for more than two months.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1924-0
00:17:35.177 --> 00:17:40.802
So this was again shown like why they
don't want cico because they don't get

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1924-1
00:17:40.802 --> 00:17:44.017
the price of their fuel that they're
given.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1927-0
00:17:45.587 --> 00:17:45.867
This was.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1962-0
00:17:49.617 --> 00:17:53.974
Yes. Similarly,
if they have taken from the pipelines and

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1962-1
00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:57.580
they have to give the cash and if the
pipeline,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1962-2
00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.313
if the pipeline is taken more gas and not
delivered that much.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1962-3
00:18:02.313 --> 00:18:04.417
So pipeline has to cash out.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1967-0
00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:06.427
Otherwise they have to pay the pipeline.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1968-0
00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:07.937
Speech.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1969-0
00:18:07.527 --> 00:18:07.767
Please.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/1978-0
00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:17.927
These were the words.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2003-0
00:18:17.927 --> 00:18:23.829
So first thing I didn't understand about
was the inventory quantity codes.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2003-1
00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:30.047
Like somewhere it has returned like the
bucket of Git that need to be tracked.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2023-0
00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:35.208
So and another, they have returned it.
The pipeline inventory tree,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2023-1
00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:38.187
spreading bugs are there.
So and image there should.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2030-0
00:18:41.017 --> 00:18:43.577
Here they're showing this is the quantity
code.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2042-0
00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:48.187
And there was a that is the buckets of
food that is being.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2045-0
00:18:51.427 --> 00:18:51.947
That which?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2073-0
00:18:54.587 --> 00:18:59.125
Like here they have shown that this is a
group in that group.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2073-1
00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:04.834
This is a subgroup and the every element
of that subgroup are quantity codes,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2073-2
00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:05.347
but so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2086-0
00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:13.387
On the team codes are like packing
separate guest day, particular day.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2107-0
00:19:14.827 --> 00:19:21.132
And three is summarizing if having some
groups and like whatever you can see it's

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2107-1
00:19:21.132 --> 00:19:22.747
all summarized there.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2112-0
00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:26.347
For, that's my understanding.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2120-0
00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:32.577
So what does that mean?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2130-0
00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:36.697
The quantity codes are the bucket of gas
that need to be tracked separately.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2138-0
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:42.597
Pause that thought.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2153-0
00:19:42.597 --> 00:19:46.222
It is something related to the
measurement unit,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2153-1
00:19:46.222 --> 00:19:49.477
but then the image confused me like is
the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2152-0
00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:48.797
Yes.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2166-0
00:20:16.877 --> 00:20:18.597
This line and this.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2189-0
00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:26.761
<v Pooja Joshi>I think I'm not sure this tree or diagram
if we refer we can I think see this</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2189-1
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:30.975
<v Pooja Joshi>similar in the I think PDF submission
screen.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2192-0
00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:36.015
<v Pooja Joshi>PDF submission screen or?</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2193-0
00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:37.015
<v Pooja Joshi>Um.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2203-0
00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:42.815
<v Pooja Joshi>There is one more screen on that we can
see the diagrams.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2212-0
00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:48.255
<v Pooja Joshi>I think we can mention I think ATT IDs
also.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2219-0
00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:54.215
<v Pooja Joshi>I think in video submission screen only.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2223-0
00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:01.975
<v Pooja Joshi>Yes, yes, yes.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2240-0
00:21:05.857 --> 00:21:14.124
Well, for this inventory quantity rules,
so they mentioned multiple like each to

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2240-1
00:21:14.124 --> 00:21:14.737
group.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2246-0
00:21:16.387 --> 00:21:17.867
Like I didn't remember like.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2265-0
00:21:20.157 --> 00:21:25.093
Like for every attribute they have
mentioned some of the rule criteria like

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2265-1
00:21:25.093 --> 00:21:26.197
builder criteria.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2270-0
00:21:26.197 --> 00:21:30.037
So they've mentioned that, yeah,
like location attribute.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2283-0
00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:35.907
There's a field that has to be checked if
the location has to be.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2285-0
00:21:37.947 --> 00:21:38.387
To be not.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2296-0
00:21:42.497 --> 00:21:45.257
So yeah, they've mentioned multiple rules.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2302-0
00:21:45.257 --> 00:21:48.257
They are not remembering it.
Everything they do.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2312-0
00:21:54.467 --> 00:21:57.987
To hear their mentioned all the rules in
summary.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2323-0
00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:04.187
Like every rule,
their description and what are the basis?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2326-0
00:22:05.827 --> 00:22:06.307
Gets affected.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2332-0
00:22:13.677 --> 00:22:15.077
Read this one but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2343-0
00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:21.107
Like I guess it would be required in some
specific.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2354-0
00:22:23.827 --> 00:22:26.747
Not sure too much about this then.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2355-0
00:22:26.827 --> 00:22:30.547
Then groups are quantity 4.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2360-0
00:22:35.717 --> 00:22:36.117
OK so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2384-0
00:22:38.667 --> 00:22:43.546
The from the inventory compared is shown
in the inventory adjustment period only,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2384-1
00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.867
so it is available in this screen only.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2390-0
00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:51.227
This favorite take on bread.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2424-0
00:23:02.577 --> 00:23:09.759
So when screening the the classic
application where we can use to see the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2424-1
00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:14.708
monthly,
monthly basis records of monthly data for

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2424-2
00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:15.097
the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2431-0
00:23:18.107 --> 00:23:21.027
So these are the reports.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2435-0
00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:28.487
It's not inventory it.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2446-0
00:23:33.947 --> 00:23:37.667
TSV milling configuration.
This is the plastic.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2457-0
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:42.207
So this was used for the setup for the.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2459-0
00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:45.647
2nd.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2463-0
00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:47.087
Configuration.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2476-0
00:23:51.457 --> 00:23:56.897
So it is again the setups screen and most
of the things.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2481-0
00:23:59.597 --> 00:24:00.917
The real effective date.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2491-0
00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:07.207
That is date range.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2503-0
00:24:15.407 --> 00:24:18.567
You know this open-ended date is 9000.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2505-0
00:24:20.727 --> 00:24:21.367
So.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2531-0
00:24:22.577 --> 00:24:29.810
So the configuration setting that we're
talking and the building details like it

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2531-1
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:35.257
is in dollar and bookings are in detail
and invoice is done.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2536-0
00:24:35.257 --> 00:24:37.177
So it is delivered to the main.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2543-0
00:24:38.507 --> 00:24:41.547
This is the payment type option.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2551-0
00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:44.547
Mostly we use this payment option for.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2569-0
00:24:48.047 --> 00:24:51.037
Yes,
this is configuration settings and these

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2569-1
00:24:51.037 --> 00:24:55.327
were the other document that needs to be
included in the invoice.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2610-0
00:25:26.857 --> 00:25:32.950
For each and every contract like we can
add it here and based on that we can

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2610-1
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:39.201
generate what other documents would be
involved in the invoice and who whom we

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2610-2
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:41.417
want that copies to be sent.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2632-0
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:47.082
So when the original copy would be sent
to, I guess the agent and other,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2632-1
00:25:47.082 --> 00:25:50.087
we can send copies to different people
also.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2646-0
00:25:51.157 --> 00:25:55.014
You're gonna end the contracts here,
the DNA and the investor,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2646-1
00:25:55.014 --> 00:25:56.117
he gets generated.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2656-0
00:25:58.497 --> 00:26:04.057
For every contact you can have in your
inbox right in contact.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2680-0
00:26:05.387 --> 00:26:10.759
Screen there is an invoices tab as well,
so you can see there as well that to

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2680-1

which invoices your contact is added.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2697-0
00:26:13.787 --> 00:26:17.623
Otherwise,
you can if it's not added to any invoices

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2697-1
00:26:17.623 --> 00:26:18.347
inventory.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2698-0
00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:19.547
You can add.

There always needs to be at least one
record in that copies app, OK.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2723-0
00:26:27.697 --> 00:26:31.457
There should be at least 21 where you get
the original copy here.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2726-0
00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:32.497

So there we create invoice ID.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2757-0
00:26:54.247 --> 00:26:54.447

00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:32.267
The difference between the process and
the report so.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2829-0
00:27:34.067 --> 00:27:40.652
Report was like can we run for any month
past or present so it would generate the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2829-1
00:27:40.652 --> 00:27:44.427
report for that but the process would be
done.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2840-0
00:27:44.777 --> 00:27:48.617
Generate for the current accounting
method, maybe for the future or.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2845-0
00:27:50.557 --> 00:27:53.077
Not from the past, but.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2851-0
00:27:55.887 --> 00:28:00.327
Final word and it would calculate all the
charges here.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2866-0
00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:06.979

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2872-0
00:28:08.547 --> 00:28:10.187
Open diary processes.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2879-0
00:28:13.147 --> 00:28:13.467
BLINDGEN.

Prior period I just went.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2978-0
00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:19.327
Be clear.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/2981-0

It's gets triggered the reallocation and
PPA generally get triggered.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3017-0
00:29:29.157 --> 00:29:34.570
So by two or three screens,
like by the contract and the pipeline

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3017-1
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.917
admin and in the PPA event maintenance,
we can view.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3025-0
00:29:39.687 --> 00:29:42.367
Even from that reverse source where that?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3036-0
00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:48.407
The PPS created and the data's changed.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3047-0
00:29:48.407 --> 00:29:51.667
And the type of service and what are the
things?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3047-1
00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:54.927
So it is done for the previous accounting
month?

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3050-0
00:29:56.807 --> 00:29:57.327
To change their.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3072-0
00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:04.434
And the reallocation is also done
accordingly and whenever the PP is

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3072-1
00:30:04.434 --> 00:30:08.157
created one of the batch process
mentioned.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3080-0
00:30:09.687 --> 00:30:11.447
One more than one batch process also gets.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3109-0
00:30:13.407 --> 00:30:19.250
Loads so to collect the data throughout
the like maybe in allocation or in

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3109-1
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:23.847
invoice 2-3 basis.
It has shown that the batch process is.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3126-0
00:30:28.047 --> 00:30:35.152
So this was if the PPA it does not

But didn't understand what this was used
for.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3270-0
00:33:07.997 --> 00:33:10.877

<v Pooja Joshi>Most of all these things are related to
the billing or finance related things.</v>

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3309-0
00:33:33.567 --> 00:33:39.218
But I did exactly understand like where
exactly this screen would be required or

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3309-1
00:33:39.218 --> 00:33:39.567

00:33:39.677 --> 00:33:43.380
So like if something comes up related to
this,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3324-1
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.477
I didn't understand where the screen
would be used.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3360-0
00:33:51.937 --> 00:33:56.161

00:33:56.161 --> 00:34:02.233
even a transaction should be booked to
including invoice like items,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3360-2
00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:07.337

inventory balances.

00:34:08.127 --> 00:34:14.508
Each entry in the chart of accounts must
specify an account and an offset account,

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3386-1
00:34:14.508 --> 00:34:18.967
which ensures that debits and credits are
always created.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3395-0
00:34:20.537 --> 00:34:23.097

Initial strength configurations and
obtained only when the target departments

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3428-1
00:34:55.417 --> 00:34:56.207
are changed.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3438-0
00:35:01.707 --> 00:35:03.987
What this only chart accounts.

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3461-0
00:35:04.627 --> 00:35:10.539

so we get add that here to relate to this

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3461-1
00:35:10.539 --> 00:35:16.776
like we can create a relation between the
server and I didn't understand the

eaf3d8fe-5f65-4fd0-aed4-e0aa414b6935/3461-2
00:35:16.776 --> 00:35:17.667

So these were the building reports
traditionally.
